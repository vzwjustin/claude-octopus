# Architecture: Models, Providers, and Execution Flow

This document explains how Claude Octopus orchestrates multiple AI providers and the execution flow of each workflow.

---

## Overview

Claude Octopus coordinates **three AI providers** to give you multi-perspective analysis:

```
    +------------------+
    |   Claude Code    |  <-- Orchestrator (you talk to this)
    +--------+---------+
             |
    +--------v---------+
    | Claude Octopus   |  <-- Plugin coordinates providers
    +--------+---------+
             |
     +-------+-------+
     |       |       |
+----v--+ +--v---+ +-v----+
| Codex | |Gemini| |Claude|
|  CLI  | | CLI  | |  AI  |
+-------+ +------+ +------+
    |         |        |
+---v---+ +---v---+ +--v---+
|OpenAI | |Google | |Anthr.|
| API   | |  API  | | API  |
+-------+ +-------+ +------+
```

## Provider → Model Mapping

| Provider | CLI Tool | Underlying Model | Cost Source |
|----------|----------|------------------|-------------|
| **Codex CLI** | `codex exec --model gpt-5.3-codex` | GPT-5.3-Codex (high-capability) | Your `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| **Gemini CLI** | `gemini -y -m gemini-3.1-pro-preview` | Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview | Your `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| **Claude** | Built-in | Claude Sonnet 4.6 / Opus 4.6 | Your Claude Code subscription |

> **Note:** Models are as of February 2026. The orchestrate.sh script uses the latest available models.

### What Each Provider Excels At

| Provider | Strengths | Best For |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Codex (OpenAI)** | Code generation, structured output, technical analysis | Implementation approaches, code patterns, API design |
| **Gemini (Google)** | Research synthesis, documentation, broad knowledge | Ecosystem research, best practices, alternative perspectives |
| **Claude** | Strategic synthesis, nuanced analysis, code review | Final synthesis, quality assessment, moderation |

---

## Execution Flow by Workflow

### Discover Phase (probe)

**Trigger:** `octo research X` or `/octo:discover`

```

    | Synthesis|
    +----------+
          |
          v
    Final Research
       Report
```

**Execution:**
1. Codex CLI and Gemini CLI run **in parallel** with the research prompt
2. Both responses are collected
3. Claude synthesizes both perspectives into a unified report

**Typical duration:** 30-60 seconds  
**Typical cost:** $0.01-0.05 (depending on prompt length)

---

### Define Phase (grasp)

**Trigger:** `octo define X` or `/octo:define`

```
User Request
     |
     v
+--------------------+
|   Claude Octopus   |
+---------+----------+
          |
          v
    +-----------+
    |   Codex   |   <- Step 1: Problem statement
    +-----------+
          |
          v
    +-----------+
    |  Gemini   |   <- Step 2: Success criteria
    +-----------+
          |
          v

    |  Gemini   |   <- Step 3: Constraints

    | Consensus |
    +-----------+
          |
          v
   Problem Definition
    + Requirements
```

**Execution:** (Sequential for coherent problem definition)
1. Codex defines the core problem statement (2-3 sentences)
2. Gemini defines success criteria (3-5 measurable criteria)
3. Gemini defines constraints and boundaries
4. Gemini synthesizes all perspectives into unified requirements

---

### Develop Phase (tangle)

**Trigger:** `octo build X` or `/octo:develop`

```
User Request

     v
+--------------------+
|   Claude Octopus   |
+---------+----------+
          |
    +-----+-----+
    |           |
    v           v
+-------+   +-------+
| Codex |   |Gemini |   <- PARALLEL: Implementation proposals
+---+---+   +---+---+
    |           |
    v           v

    |           |

    |   Gate   |
    +----------+
       |     |
   PASS?    FAIL?
       |     |
       v     v
   Continue  Revise
```

**Execution:**
1. Codex and Gemini each propose implementation approaches
2. Claude merges the best elements from both
3. **Quality Gate** checks if merged approach meets 75% consensus threshold
4. If failed: Loop back for revision
5. If passed: Proceed to implementation

**Quality Gate:**
The quality gate is based on subtask success rate:
- Measures: percentage of subtasks that completed successfully
- Threshold: 75% (configurable via `CLAUDE_OCTOPUS_QUALITY_THRESHOLD`)
- If failed: Can retry, escalate to human review, or abort

### Deliver Phase (ink)

**Trigger:** `octo review X` or `/octo:deliver`

```

          v

   + Go/No-Go Decision
```

**Execution:**
1. Codex reviews code quality, patterns, maintainability
2. Gemini reviews security, edge cases, compliance
3. Claude synthesizes into validation report
4. Quality score determines go/no-go recommendation

**Validation Thresholds:**
| Score | Status | Recommendation |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| >= 90% | PASSED | Ship it |
| 75-89% | WARNING | Ship with caution |
| < 75% | FAILED | Do not ship |

```

**Execution:**
1. **Round 1:** All three providers argue their positions in parallel
2. **Round 2+ (optional):** Rebuttals and counter-arguments
3. **Synthesis:** Claude moderates and produces final verdict

**Debate Styles:**
| Style | Rounds | Approach |
|-------|--------|----------|
| quick | 1 | Fast positions, immediate synthesis |
| thorough | 2-3 | Multiple rounds of debate |
| adversarial | 3 | Providers actively critique each other |
| collaborative | 2 | Providers build on each other's ideas |

### Full Workflow (embrace)

**Trigger:** `/octo:embrace`

```
User Request
     |
     v
+---------+
| DISCOVER|  <- Phase 1
+---------+
     |
     v
+---------+
|  DEFINE |  <- Phase 2
+---------+
     |
     v
+---------+
| DEVELOP |  <- Phase 3 (with quality gate)
+---------+
     |
     v
+---------+
| DELIVER |  <- Phase 4
+---------+
     |
     v
  Complete
  Feature
```

**Execution:**
All four phases run sequentially. Each phase uses the output of the previous phase as context.

**Typical duration:** 2-5 minutes  
**Typical cost:** $0.10-0.30

---

## Cost Breakdown

### Per-Query Estimates

| Workflow | Codex Cost | Gemini Cost | Total |
|----------|------------|-------------|-------|
| discover | $0.01-0.02 | $0.01-0.02 | $0.02-0.04 |
| define | $0.01-0.02 | $0.01-0.02 | $0.02-0.04 |
| develop | $0.02-0.05 | $0.02-0.05 | $0.04-0.10 |
| deliver | $0.01-0.03 | $0.01-0.03 | $0.02-0.06 |
| debate | $0.02-0.05 | $0.02-0.05 | $0.05-0.15 |
| embrace | $0.05-0.10 | $0.05-0.10 | $0.10-0.30 |

**Note:** Claude costs are included in your Claude Code subscription (Pro, Max 5x, Max 20x).

### Cost Optimization

| Strategy | How |
|----------|-----|
| **Use one provider** | Only install Codex OR Gemini (not both) |
| **Skip unnecessary phases** | Use `/octo:develop` instead of `/octo:embrace` for simple tasks |
| **Use Claude-only** | For simple tasks, don't use "octo" prefix - just ask directly |

---

## Provider Detection

Claude Octopus auto-detects which providers are available:

```bash
# Check status
/octo:setup

# Output example:
# Providers:
#   Codex CLI: ready (OPENAI_API_KEY found)
#   Gemini CLI: ready (OAuth authenticated)
```

### Graceful Degradation

| Available Providers | Behavior |
|--------------------|----------|
| Codex + Gemini | Full multi-AI orchestration |
| Codex only | Dual perspective (Codex + Claude) |
| Gemini only | Dual perspective (Gemini + Claude) |
| Neither | Claude-only mode (basic functionality) |

---

## Visual Indicators

When multi-AI mode is active, you'll see these indicators:

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| 🐙 | Claude Octopus orchestration active |
| 🔴 | Codex CLI executing (OpenAI) |
| 🟡 | Gemini CLI executing (Google) |
| 🔵 | Claude subagent processing |

**Example output:**
```
🐙 CLAUDE OCTOPUS ACTIVATED - Multi-provider research mode
🔍 Discover Phase: Researching authentication patterns

🔴 Codex CLI: Analyzing implementation patterns...
🟡 Gemini CLI: Researching ecosystem best practices...
🔵 Claude: Synthesizing perspectives...

[Final synthesis report]
```

---

## Under the Hood: orchestrate.sh

All workflows are powered by `scripts/orchestrate.sh`:

```bash
# Direct CLI usage (advanced)
./scripts/orchestrate.sh probe "research OAuth patterns"
./scripts/orchestrate.sh tangle "implement authentication"
./scripts/orchestrate.sh ink "review auth code"
./scripts/orchestrate.sh embrace "complete auth feature"
```

The plugin wraps these commands and provides:
- Natural language triggers
- Session management
- Result storage
- Quality gates
